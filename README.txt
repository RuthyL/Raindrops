In this game, there will be raindrops falling from the top. At the bottom there will be a catcher, 
which the player will be in control of using the left and right arrow keys. 
If the player doesn't catch a certain number of raindrops in a determined period of time, 
he/she loses the game. The player has three lives, or three chances to win.
