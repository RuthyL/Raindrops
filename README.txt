In this game, there will be raindrops falling from the top of the screen. Your catcher, controlled by the mouse,
will be an umbrella, ready to catch the incoming drops. To level up, you have to catch 20 drops
while still having all 10 lives left. Score is kept on the game screen.
Each time you level up, the speed of the drops increases, and the game gets harder.
When you lose all of your lives, it is game over.
