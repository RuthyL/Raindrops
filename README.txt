In this game, there will be raindrops falling from the cloud at the top of the screen. Your catcher, controlled by the mouse,
will be a little girl with her mouth open, ready to catch the incoming drops. To level up, you have to catch 20 drops
while still having lives left. Score is kept at the console area- the black rectangle at the bottom of the Processing environment. 
Each time you level up, the speed of the raindrops increases, and the game gets harder.
When you lose all of your lives, it is game over.
