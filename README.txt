In this game, there will be stars falling from the top of the screen. Your catcher, controlled by the mouse,
will be open hands, ready to catch the incoming stars. To level up, you have to catch 20 drops
while still having lives left. Score is kept at the console area- the black rectangle at the bottom of the Processing environment. 
Each time you level up, the speed of the stars increases, and the game gets harder.
When you lose all of your lives, it is game over.
